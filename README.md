this is a temporary file
	have a short description
	what it is
	how to run/compile it


prog2_1.c
	This program gets a user input and takes from it the first 65 characters not including whitespace with an = sign on each ends of the string each on a new line
    it is a compilable c program that formats an input to single term prints
    you run and compile it in the command prompt enter an input after it begins running and press enter 

prog2_2.c
    This program gets a user input and takes the first 65 characters not including whitespace and prints STR or INT respectivly
    it is a compilable c program that determines whether a term is a string or number and then prints the results
    you run and compile it in the command prompt enter an input after it begins running and press enter 

prog2_3.c
    This program gets a user input and takes the first 65 characters not including whitespace and will print STR or INT respectivly but only up to two terms
    it is a compilable c program that determines whether an input has more than 2 terms and if less then if the terms are a string or an int
    you run and compile it in the command promt then you are prompted with a carrot to enter an input 

prog2_4.c
    This program gets a user input and if string is longer than 20 characters it outputs an error message, if it is less than 3 terms it then prints STR or INT respectivly
    it is a compilable c program that determines whether an input has more than a correct number or characters and terms and then prints if they are a string or number
    you run and compile it in the command prompt then you are prompted with a carrot to enter an input and the only way to break is write quit not case sensitive 

prog2_5.c
    This program gets a user input and if the string is longer than 65 characters it ouputs an error message if it is more than 2 terms it outputs a different error message
    it is a compilable c program that destermines if the first term is a STR and if there is a second term if its an INT then will print respective terms but if not the will 
    output an error message you compile it in the command prompt then you are prompted with a carrot to enter an input and quit will end it not case sensitive

prog2_6.c
    literally the same thing as 5 but it takes a command line arguement in argv and determines if its an integer and will then run the program that number of times unless the 
    user enters quit not case sensitive
    you compile and run it in command prompt with a command line level arguement if it is not an int it will output the respective error message
